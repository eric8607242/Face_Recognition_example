# Face_Recognition_example

This is a example repo for face recognition. We cover the basic component for face recognition. (e.g., loss function, data loader, and inference)

**The main components in this repo.**
* Loss function
    * SphereFace
    * CosFace
    * ArgFace

**Actually, I am still confused about some implementation detail for face recognition. Hope anyone can help me to clarify more implementation detail.**
